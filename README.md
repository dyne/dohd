Dohd (pron. doh-dee) is a minimalist DNS-over-HTTPS daemon that redirects all DoH queries
to a traditional DNS server open to UDP queries.

## Features

- Support for RFC8484 DNS-over-HTTPS (POST and GET method) - HTTP/2
- Record freshness derived from minimum TTL among answers
- Optimized and readable C code below 1500 locs
- Privacy focused, no logs are kept

***
# üíæ Install

Build system requirements: gcc or clang, GNU make

1. Ensure that [wolfSSL](https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl) is
installed on your system, and configured to support TLS 1.3 (configure
option: `--enable-tls13` or simply `--enable-all`).

2. Type `make`.

3. Executable will be found in `./src/dohd`

***
# üéÆ Quick start

Commands must be issued as root on the host machine.

Generate a fake local certificate for testing:

```
openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/test.key -out /etc/test.csr \
    -subj "/C=IT/ST=Rome/L=Rome/O=Local Host/OU=Testing Department/CN=example.com" \
    && openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 \
    -in /etc/test.csr -signkey /etc/test.key -out /etc/test.crt
```

Create a dohd user and grant it access to certificates
```
adduser -D -H -s /bin/false dohd
chown dohd:dohd /etc/test.*
```

Start dohd as root to proxy all queries to a public dns and drop privileges to dohd user

```
dohd -c /etc/test.crt -k /etc/test.key -p 8053 -d 8.8.8.8 -u dohd -F
```

1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the **General** menu, scroll down to access **Network Settings**.
![firefox network settings](docs/firefox_net_set_1.jpg)
1. Click on the **Settings** button.
1. Click **Enable DNS over HTTPS**. Use provider **Custom** and write **https://dns.dyne.org**.
![firefox enable dns over https](docs/firefox_net_set_2.jpg)
1. Then go to Firefox [about:config](about:config)
![firefox about config](docs/firefox_net_set_3.jpg)
1. And search for **network.trr.mode** then set it to **2** (first) or **3** (only) (see [Only use TRR, never use the native resolver](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver))
![firefox trr set](docs/firefox_net_set_4.jpg)
1. Enjoy DOHD! See it works from [about:networking](about:networking)

## dohd daemon

Commandline options are few, help is shown using `-h`

```
Usage: dohd -c cert -k key [-p port] [-d dnsserver] [-F] [-u user] [-V] [-v] [-h]

	'cert' and 'key': certificate and its private key.
	'user' : login name (when running as root) to switch to (dropping permissions)
	Default values: port=8053 dnsserver="::1"
	Use '-h' for help
	Use '-V' to show version
	Use '-v' for verbose mode
	Use '-F' for foreground mode
```

- '-c *certificate*' - specifies which certificate for the TLS server. (Mandatory parameter)
- '-k *private-key*' - specifies the private key used by the TLS server. (Mandatory parameter)
- '-p *port*' - changes the listening port for the DoH service (default:8053)
- '-u *user*' - drop root privileges after binding to the TCP port by switching user (mandatory when running as root)
- '-F' - runs dohd in foreground (instead of creating a daemon)
